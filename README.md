# Pixel Sketch
A simple and fun drawing game developed with the purpose of practicing and improving my **DOM manipulation** skills.
## Functionalities
- Select any color for the pen and for the background;
- Grab colors from the canvas;
- Paint bucket tool;
- Rainbow mode: paint each pixel with a randomly generated color;
- Apply shading/lighting;
- Eraser;
- Clear the entire canvas;
- Create a grid with a size up to 64x64.
###### **Future implementation ideas**
 - Save your current art as an image file;
 - Undo functionality.
